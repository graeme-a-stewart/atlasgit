# File listing SVN packages that are completely vetoed

# Note - this is done in a separate file from atlasoffline-exceptions.txt
# as that filtering mechanism prioritises glob accept over glob reject,
# thus a package filtered by "- some/path/*" can have some files
# accepted trivially (like ChangeLog or Test XMLs)
