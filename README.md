ATLAS SVN to git puller
=======================

This is a script to pull arbitrary SVN package versions and import them
into an already checked out git repository (use `svnpull.py --help` for more
details).

Usually to use this script you should setup the most recent ATLAS git and
python versions:

```sh
setupATLAS; lsetup git python
```
