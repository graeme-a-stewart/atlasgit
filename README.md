ATLAS SVN to git puller
=======================

This is a script to pull arbitrary SVN package versions and import them
into an already checked out git repository (use `svnpull.py --help` for more
details).

Please not that python2.7 is required, so if you don't have that in your
environment then try `setupATLAS; lsetup python`.

Please report any problems to Graeme <graeme.andrew.stewart@cern.ch>
